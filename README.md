## Installing Instructions

You must create a new conda environment with the following command in Anaconda prompt:

```bash
conda env create --file pept_seq.yml
```

The previous command will create an environment with all the dependencies needed to run the code.

Once the environment is created, you can activate it in the Anaconda Prompt with:

```bash
conda activate pept_seq.yml
```
## Settings

All the possible settings are in one [settings.py](./src/settings.py) file.


## Usage

There's a [Jupyter Notebook](./Example.ipynb) example with how to use the code.
